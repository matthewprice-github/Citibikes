Mapping NYC Citibike data with Tableau 

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to visualize NYC citibike data in order to better convince investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Being able to better visualize key data points like location of trip starts, location of trip stops, trip duration, and peak usage times, we are better able to present a complete story with data, which can be understood quickly and easily.

* Most Popular Starting Locations: a map of NYC outlining the most popular trip start locations for citibikes. Manhattan clearly has the highest density of trip starts, which makes sense. 
* Most Popular Ending Locations: Almost exactly the same map as starting locations, which indicaates that the majority of citibike trips end in the same location where they begin, and the trips are circular. 
* Checkout Times: Outlines count of bike trips by trip duration. We can see that virtually all trips are under an hour, with the mode being 6 minutes. 
* Checkout Times by Gender: The same visual as before but broken out by gender. We see the volume of trips skew towards, but male and female riders show the same behavior with trip duration. 
* Trips by Weekday per Hour: Shows peak times by hour for citibike trips. It makes sense that during the week peak usage is before and after working hours. On the weekend the trips are more evenly distributed thrughout the day. 
* Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): Same view as above but split by gender. Again the volume is skewed towards men, but women and women share the same behavior here as well. 
* User Trips by Gender by Weekday: Outlines trips by days of the week, broken down by subscription level and gender. Here most of the observations are in the Male Subscriber bucket, so it is hard to glean patterns compared to the other bucket. On the side panel we can toggle off different cateogries to see more apples to apples comparisons. Looking at Just Male and Demale subscribers, they once again share the smae behavior, with trips more often happening during the weekday (except Wednesdays, curiously).
