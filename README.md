Mapping NYC Citibike data with Tableau 

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to visualize NYC citibike data in order to better convince investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Being able to better visualize key data points like location of trip starts, location of trip stops, trip duration, and peak usage times, we are better able to present a complete story with data, which can be understood quickly and easily.
